## Brief Description
``
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to various microscopy and medical datasets.
However, these methods depend on large-labeled datasets. To address the limitations of current EDS detectors and CNNs,
propose a novel technique for automatic labeling and segmentaition on limited datasets.
