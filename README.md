## Brief Description
``
EDS detectors often struggle to distinguish
materials with similar energy outputs, resulting in noisy EDS
maps. Additionally, EDS requires extensive imaging times to
achieve optimal performance. Convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have been applied to various microscopy datasets.
However, these methods depend on large-labeled datasets. To
address the limitations of current EDS detectors and CNNs,
propose a novel technique for automatic material character-
ization.
